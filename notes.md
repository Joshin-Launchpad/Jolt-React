Put any notes for us here.
- I was only able to get to '(2.)' of 'Part I'. My experience with React is still young and working with APIs is very new. I think the inability to gain access to the API data was my downfall. If I would have been able to figure that out, I would have gotten further and demonstrated further understanding.
- The opportunity to attempt this challenge was much appreciated. I'm excited to take what I learned and apply it to future pursuits.
